I'm a freelance digital generalist with skills and experience in product, delivery and research.

Most recently, I was a Product Manager at HMPPS, Ministry of Justice, exploring digital services for prisoners. Previously I was User Research Lead for the Connected Communities team at Co-op Digital.

I started out as a Caseworker for a Member of Parliament, as Head of Design and Manufacturing Policy at a [political thinktank] (https://jekyllrb.com/), and as a Private Secretary at the Ministry of Justice.

I built a tool to support childcare co-operatives, and worked with MPs to use speculative design to explore the future of assisted dying.

In my spare time, I co-organise a festival celebrating maintenance and what it can teach us about being better custodians of technology and communities.

I'm enthusiastic about data minimisation and making policy tangible through design.
