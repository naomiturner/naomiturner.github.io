**The British Library**
**The ask: deliver a ‘single digital presence’ 
**
I was engaged by the British Library to revive a project for a ‘single digital presence’ - a new digital platform to promote what public libraries bring to communities across England. 

The British Library had been commissioned by Arts Council England to build a website to increase knowledge and use of public libraries. The organisation had low digital capability and was early in its digital transformation journey, with wide-ranging but undefined ambitions for what a digital presence could achieve.  

This, along with the 2020 pandemic, had resulted in the project stalling.
